## 1. Purpose

The College Survey Application is designed to collect, manage, and analyze feedback from students regarding their respective colleges. It allows institutions to understand student satisfaction, gather insights, and make informed decisions to improve the academic environment and facilities. The application also provides authorized users with access to survey reports for review and analysis.

## 2. User Roles

The application supports two types of users, each with different permissions:

### a) Student

Permissions: Can register and log in to their account. Can participate only in surveys related to their own college. Can view reports of other colleges but cannot participate in their surveys.

Purpose: Collects firsthand feedback about the student’s own college.

### b) User (Viewer)

Description: Users are individuals (faculty, administrators, or external reviewers) who are allowed to analyze survey results.

Permissions: Can register and log in to their account. Can view survey reports of all colleges. Cannot participate in any surveys.

Purpose: Provides a read-only access to survey reports for analysis, monitoring, and decision-making.
